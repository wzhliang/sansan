<H1>1. General SGF FF[4] Example File</H1>

<H2>Purpose</H2>

The example SGF file and the GIF pictures should illustrate some of the
features of SGF FF[4] and give application coders an impression how to draw
or represent various properties.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> The colors chosen, the screen structure (seperate window for
variations & other information, seperate comment window) etc. are specific
to Primiview, the application used to create these pictures.
<P>
Your application doesn't have to look the same.<BR>
You are free to choose whatever colors, structures etc. you want.
Same goes for representation of advanced markup such as DD (dimmed points).

<H2>General comments</H2>

Primiview's node numbering starts with zero (0) (just like MGT).
Node numbering is done in the order the nodes appear in the SGF file.
<P>
If your application can't handle SGF collections then you have to extract
the second part using a split utility or a text editor.

<H2>Gametree 1: properties</H2>

<H3>Variation A: (Moves, comments, annotations)</H3>
<UL>
<LI><B>Nodes:</B> 1-13
<LI><B>Pictures:</B>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="ex01.gif">ex01.gif</A>: B, W (node 11)
</UL></UL>

There's nothing special about these nodes.<BR>
Note the new (FF[4]) way to write pass moves: "B[]", "W[]" (nodes 12, 13)


<H3>Variation B: (Setup)</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Nodes:</B> 14-17
<LI><B>Pictures:</B>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="ex02.gif">ex02.gif</A>: AB,AW (node 14)
<LI><A HREF="ex03.gif">ex03.gif</A>: AE (node 15)
</UL></UL>

This variation illustrates how to use AB, AW, AE & PL.<BR>
Here compressed point lists are used for the first time.
Have a look at the SGF specification and the two pictures to get the idea.


<H3>Variation C: (Markup)</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Nodes: 18-21</B>
<LI><B>Pictures:</B>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="ex04.gif">ex04.gif</A>: MA, TR, CR, SQ, SL, TB, TW (node 19)
<LI><A HREF="ex05.gif">ex05.gif</A>: LB (node 20)
<LI><A HREF="ex06.gif">ex06.gif</A>: LB, different ways of handling long labels (node 20)
<LI><A HREF="ex07.gif">ex07.gif</A>: AR, LN, DD (node 21)
<LI><A HREF="ex08.gif">ex08.gif</A>: VW (node 19)
</UL></UL>

Node 19 shows various kind of board markup.<BR>
Node 20 shows labels. Label length are from 1-8 chars.
There are two pictures: the second one shows different ways of handling
long labels.<BR>
Node 21 shows three new FF[4] properties: DD (dimmed points),
AR (arrows) and LN (lines)
<P>
The picture ex08.gif illustartes how VW (view) works.<BR>
The VW property isn't directly encoded into the SGF file.
The picture shows node 19 and gives two examples of a restricted view.


<H3>Variation D: (Style & text type)</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Nodes:</B> 22-32
<LI><B>Pictures:</B>
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="ex09.gif">ex09.gif</A>: ST[2] (children / no board markup)   (node 23)
<LI><A HREF="ex10.gif">ex10.gif</A>: ST[1] (siblings / auto-board markup) (node 23)
</UL></UL>

Node 22 contains a comment text which serves as example for hard and
soft linebreaks and for different encodings of linebreaks.
<P>
Note that ex09.gif & ex10.gif are both taken from the same node (#23).
They only differ in the ST (style) used. The example itself doesn't contain
a ST property. The picture just illustrates the use of ST.


<H3>Variation E: (Time limits, captures & move numbers)</H3>

<UL>
<LI><B>Nodes:</B> 33-53
<LI><B>Pictures:</B> -
</UL>

This variation shows the use of BL, WL, OB, OW, MN.<BR>
It also contains a suicidal move (and capture).


<H2>Gametree 2: Game-info</H2>

This game-tree shows how game-info properties may be stored, if there are
several games merged into a single gametree. See the comment texts for
what the game-info should look like.

<H1>2. Print Example Files</H1>

SGF provides some properties for storing print and layout information.
These properties are: FG, VW, PM and MN.
<P>
The following files contain two games from GoWorld 78 (of course, the commentary isn't
included, but all the board-markup is). You should have this magazine to
verify the layout with the example files.
<UL>
<LI><A HREF="print1.sgf">print1.sgf</A> - 21st Mejin, game 2
<LI><A HREF="print2.sgf">print2.sgf</A> - 51st Honinbo, game 5
</UL>
